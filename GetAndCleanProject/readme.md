run_analysis.R contains the scripts which download the data and tidy the data to meet the following demands:

1 - Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2 - Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3 - Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4 - Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
5 - From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

Comments are within the code stating what each step of the code does in order to meet the aforementioned goals.
